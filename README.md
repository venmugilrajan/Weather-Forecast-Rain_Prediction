# üåßÔ∏èRain Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using machine learning models (Naive Bayes and Random Forest) trained on weather data features such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and pressure. The web app is powered by Gradio for an interactive experience.

Features
Predicts next-day rain using Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers.

Interactive web interface via Gradio.

Input features: Humidity, Temperature, Wind Speed, Pressure.

Includes pre-trained models and scaler for reproducibility.
